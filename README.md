##About
This Application is my take on a Speed Typing Game.
The aim of the game is to re-type a given inspirational/philosophical quote in the shortest time possible with the result of continued use being an improvement in the speed and accuracy of the users typing skills. 

Why This Project?
I created this typing game for my Milestone 2 Interactive Frontend Development Project .
The project scope was to create the game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, with the core focus being the functional logic created with JavaScript.
I chose this project as it ticked a number of boxes for me with in terms of improving my Software Development skills, namely JavaScript, but also improving my typing speed while consuming positive and inspiring content.

##UX

###User Stories
* I want a game that helps improve my typing speed
* I want a clearly visible set of buttons to choose an appropriate level of difficulty
* I want a visible timer to keep track of how I am doing
* When the round is complete I want to be given my score, in this case Words Per Minute
* I want to have a clearly visible 'Help' section with information regarding Rules and Levels
* I want to have a 'Submit' page where user can submit some of their favourite quotes
* I want a 'Success' alert to show that submission has been successful.


###Research
I have been using some online speed typing games over the last few months and so I had a good idea of how they worked and what features I would need to include.
A lot of those sites used random letters or words and so I hoped that by including inspirational and interesting quotes it could engage and benefit the user a little bit more.

###Style Rationale
I kept the UI very simple.  This means that the user can see clearly what they have to type, what they have/are typing without any distractions.
This simplicity in design carried through to the fonts and clour schemes I chose.

###Wireframes
My Wireframes were hand-drawn as I knew the design was going to be very straightforward.
I have included them in the images folder
